Of course. Based on our entire conversation, including the code, the goals, and the troubleshooting steps we worked through, here is a complete `README.md` for this prototype project.

# Lark.js Parser Prototype in TypeScript

This project is a working prototype demonstrating how to integrate a parser generated by the Python **Lark** tool into a Node.js project using **TypeScript**. It serves as a template for building applications that require parsing a custom language or data format.

The example grammar provided (`sample_grammar.lark`) defines a simple parser for basic arithmetic expressions.

## Core Technologies

* **Node.js**: The runtime environment.
* **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript development.
* **Lark Parser (Python Tool)**: Used to compile a `.lark` grammar file into a standalone JavaScript parser.

## Features

* Parses basic arithmetic expressions like `10 * (2 + 3) / 5`.
* Outputs a structured JSON parse tree of the expression.
* Provides a clear workflow for regenerating the parser when the grammar changes.

## File Structure

```
.
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts                   # Main application file that uses the parser.
│   ├── sample_grammar.lark        # The grammar definition for the language.
│   └── parser_sample_grammar.js   # The auto-generated standalone JS parser.
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

- **`src/index.ts`**: The main entry point. It imports `get_parser` from the generated file and uses it to parse an example string.
- **`src/sample_grammar.lark`**: This is where the language syntax is defined. You can modify this file to change the language you want to parse.
- **`src/parser_sample_grammar.js`**: **This is an auto-generated file.** Do not edit it directly. It contains the Lark.js runtime bundled with the compiled parsing tables from your grammar.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
* **Python 3** and **`pip`**

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository (or set up your project files):**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    *(This will install `typescript`, `@types/node`, and `ts-node` based on a standard `package.json` setup for this project.)*

3.  **Install the Python Lark package:**
    It is crucial to install a specific version of Lark to avoid runtime errors with the generated code.

    ```bash
    pip install lark==1.1.2 lark-js==0.1.4
    ```

    *(See the Troubleshooting section below for more details on why this specific version is important.)*

## Usage

The workflow is a two-step process: first, you generate the parser from your grammar, and second, you run your TypeScript application which uses it.

### Step 1: Generate the Parser

Whenever you make a change to `src/sample_grammar.lark`, you must regenerate the parser file. Run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
lark-js sample_grammar.lark -o parser_sample_grammar.js
```

### Step 2: Run the Application

To compile and run the TypeScript code, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will execute `src/index.ts`, which will parse the sample expression and print the resulting parse tree to the console.

**Example Output:**

```
Input Expression: 10 * (2 + 3) / 5
Parse Tree: {
  "data": "sum",
  "children": [
    {
      "data": "product",
      "children": [
        {
          "data": "atom",
          "children": [
            {
              "type": "NUMBER",
              "value": "10",
              // ... position data
            }
          ]
        },
        // ... more tree structure
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## ⚠️ Important: Troubleshooting Lark Version Mismatch

During the development of this prototype, a common error was discovered:

```
ConfigurationError: Unknown options: strict,ordered_sets
```

This error occurs if you generate the parser with a very recent version of the Python `lark` package. The tool saves its configuration with new options (`strict`, `ordered_sets`) that the bundled JavaScript runtime doesn't recognize, causing a crash.

**The solution is to use a specific, tested version of Lark that is known to be stable and compatible.**

If you encounter this error, ensure you have the correct version installed:

```bash
# Uninstall any existing version
pip uninstall lark

# Install the recommended version
pip install lark==1.1.2
```

After installing the correct version, remember to **regenerate your parser file** using the command in the "Usage" section.
